Generates results pages (product pages, archive pages) fast for large sites.

== Description ==

It takes time to generate results pages on large sites and stores. This plugin makes that operation faster/

Thanks to Jetbrains for the use of their software development tools, especially [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/). It's hard to imagine how a plugin like this one could be developed without PhpStorm's tools for exploring epic code bases like WordPress's.
